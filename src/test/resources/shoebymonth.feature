Feature: Display upcoming shoe releases by month

Scenario Outline: Display Shoes for each month

Given I am on shoestore-manheim
When I select a <month> for shoe release  
Then month should display a small <blurb> of each shoe
Then Month should display an <image> each shoe being released
Then shoe should have a suggested <price> pricing

Examples: 
|month    |blurb                                                                                                   |image                         |price|
